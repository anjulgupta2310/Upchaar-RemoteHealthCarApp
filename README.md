## Project Details

This is a mobile based application in react-native language and database authentication from google firebase targeting both Android and IoS mo-
bile devices. The thought process behind the application is to have an efficient and easy to use platform for people.The application provides a platform for the medi-
cal healthcare professionals so that they can register themselves on the application.

They will need to register by filling in the required information to get successfully registered. Once the medical professional has successfully registered he/she can lo-
gin in to his/her account using the credentials provided. After login the person is directed to the Homepage of the application, it has several options to choose from
namely:
1. Appointments
2. E-Patient
3. Update Schedule
4. Update Profile and Charges

The above mentioned pages have been designed keeping in mind the needs of the
medical healthcare professionals. The appointments option lets the doctor check the
appointments scheduled for the day. In case the doctor wants to change the sched-
ule for some reason, the doctor can go to the Update Schedule option and make the
necessary changes in his/her schedule. If the medical professional wants to change
his/her profile such as amount of fee charged or the area of expertise, then they can
go to the Update Profile and Charges and make the necessary changes in their profile.
